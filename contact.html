    The absolute best way to contact me is by phone call -- I'll usually respond within an hour. If you don't have my
    number, send me an email at <a href='mailto: michael.tu@yale.edu;'>michael.tu@yale.edu</a>. I try to respond within
    two days, but if you don't hear from me by then, feel free to send a follow up!
