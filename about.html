    <p>Hi! I'm Michael (or Mike, if you're a Mike person). I was born in St. Louis, MO, but I currently live in New Haven,
    CT where I'm a junior at Yale University. Some things I enjoy are playing water polo, learning about computers, and
    experimenting with fermented foods. I hope you stick around!</p>
